In this repository you will find all the sound-effects, divided in categories, for your drones :flying_saucer:

In the [categories](#categories) section, you'll find two directories:

- Success
  - That you can use for the successful operations.
- Error
  - For the failed operations.

In each directory you will also find many sub-categories where the sound effects have been classified,
so that you can choose your favorites sound to make you sending operation a funny experience :sparkles:
