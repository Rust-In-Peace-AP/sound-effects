# Sound-effects

In this repository you'll find some versions of our drone. :flying_saucer:

You'll probably are thinking what are we meaning with "some versions".  
Like, "Duh, we were meant to have just 1 impl. We liked to think a little outside the box.  
We have **different**, but *equal* version of our drone. What makes them different are the, :drum: :drum: :drum:,  
**SOUND EFFECTS**.

We just wanted to make the things a little funnier adding some drone's version as:
 - Super Mario drone;
 - Among Us drone;
 - Windows XP drone;
 - **QUACK** drone;

So, if you wanna have a basic drone but with some funny feature, this is the one for you! :smirk:
