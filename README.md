In this repository you'll find some versions of our drone. 

You'll probably are thinking what are we meaning with "some versions".  
Like, "Duh, we were meant to have just 1 impl" well, we liked to think a little outside the box.  
We have **different**, but *equal* version of our drone. What makes them different are the, :drum: :drum: :drum:
**SOUND EFFECTS**.
